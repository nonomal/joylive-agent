/**
 * Implements a concurrency-based rate limiting policy. This policy limits the number of concurrent
 * requests or actions that can be performed within a system or component. It extends {@link AbstractLimitPolicy}
 * to utilize common rate limiting attributes while introducing specific properties related to concurrency control,
 * such as maximum concurrency level and maximum wait time.
 * <p>
 * This policy is useful in scenarios where it's critical to control the load on resources by limiting how many
 * concurrent operations can occur. This helps in maintaining system stability and ensuring that resources are
 * not overwhelmed by too many simultaneous requests.
