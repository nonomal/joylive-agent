/**
 * Provides a base implementation for limiting policies. This abstract class defines common attributes
 * and functionalities that all specific limiting policies should inherit. It includes basic properties
 * such as policy name, strategy type, conditions under which the policy applies, and versioning information.
 * <p>
 * The class also outlines the mechanism for limiting by specifying an algorithm or a component (e.g.,
 * FixedWindow, LeakyBucket, TokenBucket, Sentinel, Resilience4j) that implements the actual limiting logic.
 * This allows for flexible and extensible design where different limiting strategies can be easily
 * integrated and managed.
